# Differentiable Stereo Block Matching
This is a simple implementation of differentiable block matching with pytorch. The main logic is in `diffbm.py`. Please notice that this code is only made for experiment purpose and is not well-optimized (its inference time is pretty heavy). It can be a starting point for one to build a differentiable block matching module with PyTorch.
